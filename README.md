# Advanced MLOps: End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline with Random Forest Classifier

Welcome to the **Advanced MLOps** repository. This project demonstrates the end-to-end workflow for building a Machine Learning (ML) pipeline that includes data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and model deployment using MLOps best practices. The project focuses on automating and optimizing every phase of the machine learning lifecycle using **Random Forest Classifier**.

## Project Overview

In this project, we explore how MLOps principles can be applied to streamline the entire ML process—from raw data to a deployed and monitored machine learning model. Key features include:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Automation of data wrangling and feature engineering steps.
- **Model Training**: Training a Random Forest model and optimizing hyperparameters.
- **Model Evaluation**: Robust evaluation metrics and model interpretability.
- **Deployment**: CI/CD pipeline to deploy the model on a cloud platform.
- **Monitoring**: Real-time model monitoring with logging and performance alerts.
- **Version Control**: Full version control of data, model, and pipeline using Git & DVC (Data Version Control).

## Key Features

### 1. **Automated Machine Learning Pipeline**
   - **Data Ingestion**: Automated scripts for importing and cleaning data.
   - **Data Preprocessing**: Feature scaling, encoding, and missing value imputation.
   - **Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using **Random Forest Classifier** with an automated hyperparameter search (GridSearchCV, RandomSearchCV, or Bayesian Optimization).
   - **Model Validation**: Cross-validation and performance metrics (Accuracy, AUC, F1 Score).

### 2. **MLOps Workflow**
   - **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Use of tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment.
   - **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Automated infrastructure setup using Terraform or similar tools.
   - **Containerization**: Docker to encapsulate the model and its dependencies.
   - **Kubernetes**: Orchestration of containerized services for scalable deployment.

### 3. **Version Control**
   - **Data Versioning**: Implemented with **DVC (Data Version Control)** to track dataset changes over time.
   - **Model Versioning**: Each version of the model is tracked using a model registry (e.g., MLflow, DVC, or Git LFS).
   - **Pipeline Versioning**: End-to-end pipeline tracking for reproducibility.

### 4. **Monitoring and Alerts**
   - **Real-time Monitoring**: Using Prometheus and Grafana for real-time metrics like latency, prediction accuracy, and throughput.
   - **Model Drift Detection**: Periodic checks to detect performance degradation.
   - **Logging**: Centralized logging using ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for debugging and monitoring.

### 5. **Model Deployment**
   - **REST API**: Deploy model as a REST API using FastAPI or Flask.
   - **Cloud Deployment**: Use of **Azure**, **AWS**, or **Google Cloud Platform** for scalable model deployment.
   - **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated deployment pipeline with tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or Azure Pipelines.

### 6. **Reproducibility**
   - **MLflow/DVC**: Ensure reproducibility with full pipeline tracking and data version control.
   - **Docker**: Containerized environment for consistent model execution across different systems.
